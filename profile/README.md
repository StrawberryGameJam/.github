Hello and Welcome to our github Repo! We are a group of friends who studied together at [UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/) and discovered (by accident) that making video games in Game Jams is actually pretty fun (and incredibly good for you mental health).

We started as a mix of _Oioi_ (also known was the Illuminati of Computer Engineering in UNICAMP), ‚òùÔ∏è [Henrique Finger](https://github.com/fingerson) (the evil mastermind behind our begginings), and some other associates led by üëë Queen [Ana](https://github.com/AnaClaraZoppiSerpa) (The responsible for 100% of the Game Jams we participated). While our objective is not to work on Game Development, we like having this clean, nice github organization and developing our ideas of games.
