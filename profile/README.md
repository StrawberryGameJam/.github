Hello and Welcome to our github Repo! We are a group of friends who studied togheter at [UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/) and discovered (by accident) that making video games in Game Jams is actually pretty fun (and incredibly good for you mental health).

We started as a mix of _Oioi_ (also known was the Illuminati of Computer Engineering UNICAMP) and some other associates and üëë Queen [Ana](https://github.com/AnaClaraZoppiSerpa) (Dont ask how, the monarchy just exists here). While our objective is not to work on Game Development, we like having this clean, nice github organization and developing our ideas of games.

If you'd like to join or help in a project, just give us a call.
